# PyBer - Ride Sharing Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

The objective of this analysis was to provide a summary of the Ride-sharing data by City Type so that the CEO of PyBer could support his decisions based on the data provided.

## Results

With the datasets analyzed we gathered the following information: 

![Summary.](/analysis/Summary_DataFrame.png " Summary.")

We can clearly observe that Urban rides are more frequent than Rural or Suburban rides. Because of the high demand there seems to be a correlation with the number of drivers which is also high in comparison to the Rural or Suburban areas. Because of the high demand and competitiveness we can see that although there's more drivers and people using ride-sharing, the fare of each ride is lower in urban areas when compared against rural and suburban areas ( ~24.5USD vs 34.6USD and 30.97USD  respectively ).

When we look at the data across a period of time between January and April on a weekly cadence, we can observe that due to the volume of operations, Urban areas are the ones that have the higher total fares by a big margin. March seems to be the best month for Urban areas but this trend is not shared with Subruban and Rural areas. These seem to have their best weeks close to the end of the month. 

## Summary
### Recommendations

According to our observations we have the following recommendations to the CEO

1. Raising the fares in Urban areas might be a good move, because although there's a high volume of rides/drivers available the ratio of drivers to total fares is 3x smaller than what rural areas produce and 2x that of suburban areas 
2. Lowering the fares in Rural areas to incentivize users to use ride-sharing more might be a good strategy
3. Incentivizing drivers to get out of crowded zones like Urban areas and go to suburban or rural areas might be a good move since it seems more profitable and less competitive
